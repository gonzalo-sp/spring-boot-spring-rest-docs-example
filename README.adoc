= Spring Boot Spring Rest Docs example

== Summary
Example based on:
https://github.com/meistermeier/spring-rest-docs-sample

== Compiled documentation paths
You can find the generated snippets after running `mvn package` in the _target/generated-snippets_ folder. The documentation will be placed in the _target/classes/static/documentation_ folder to be served as static content from the spring boot application.

== Compile and run
Just run `mvn package spring-boot:run` to get the sample application running at http://localhost:8888.
The `package` phase is important to create the snippets, compile the documentation and place it at a static path for spring boot to pick up.
If you call this address in the browser you will be redirected to the embedded HAL browser (http://localhost:8888/browser/index.html#/).
The compiled documentation is available at http://localhost:8888/documentation/carapi.html.
